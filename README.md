## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to put the grid into practice, I'm still not completely satisfied with the result, but it's a good result

### Continued development

I desire to become a better developer so i'm gonna learn mobile first and polish some of my HTML, in a month or two I'll start javascript so I'm focusing a lot on my html and css base to move on later.
